# K-nearest-neighbors-classification

These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three
 different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines. 
 
 Based on these 13 constituents, I have tried to classify the wine into its types.
